# React Portfolio
[Live Link](https://jbrendon15.github.io/React-Portfolio/)

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Description

For this project we created a single page application with React. Clicking on the links in the Navbar will determine what content you will see in the body of the page. We learned how to use the function 'useState' in order to achieve this. We also learned how to use React styles to add some CSS styling to components on the page. 

## Usage
Run the following code on the root level to install neccessary packages:

```
npm install
```

Run the following code on the root level to start the application
```
npm start
```

Application should automatically open in your default browser, if not, enter 'localhost:3000' in your browser.
